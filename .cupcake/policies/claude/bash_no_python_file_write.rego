# title: Block Python File Writes From Bash (use Edit/Write instead)
# authors: ["er-mods-rs agents", "ds2-mods-rs agents"]
# custom:
#   severity: HIGH
#   id: DS2-MODS-BASH-NO-PYTHON-FILE-WRITE
#   description: >-
#     Hard block on editing files by running a python program from the Bash tool.
#     The shape this exists to stop is a long `python3 - <<'PY' ... open(path,
#     'w').write(s) ... PY` heredoc that rewrites a source file: the edit never
#     appears as a reviewable diff in the transcript, a single bad `replace`
#     silently no-ops or corrupts the file, and one call can burn many minutes
#     composing a program whose only job was an edit the Edit tool makes in one
#     step. User directive 2026-09-16, after ~25 minutes of one file being
#     rewritten this way: "We NEED a hook to stop you from using python to write
#     massive files."
#     Use the Edit tool for a change to an existing file and the Write tool for a
#     new one. Both are diffed, both fail loudly when the anchor does not match,
#     and neither costs a turn to compose.
#     Shell redirection is NOT blocked -- `cmd > file` and a plain heredoc into a
#     file are visible in the command itself. Only python doing the writing is.
#   routing:
#     required_events: ["PreToolUse"]
#     required_tools: ["Bash"]

# The write itself. Each pattern names a way python mutates a file on disk.
#
# `open(..., 'w')` and friends are matched on the MODE argument rather than on
# `open(` alone, so a read (`open(path)`, `open(path, 'rb')`) is untouched --
# reading a file to answer a question is the thing this guard wants to stay
# cheap. `pathlib.Path.write_text` / `write_bytes` carry the mode in the method
# name, and `shutil.copy`/`move` write without ever naming a mode.
# A python file MODE, and nothing else that happens to be a quoted string.
#
# The mode alphabet is exactly `rwxab+t`, and a real mode is at most four of them.
# Pinning both is what keeps ordinary keyword arguments out: `errors='replace'`
# begins with `r`, and a looser `['"][rwxa][a-z+]*['"]` reads it as the mode `r`
# plus `eplace` and denies a pure read. Measured 2026-09-16, one command after this
# guard landed -- `open(p, encoding='utf8', errors='replace').read()` was refused,
# which is a guard blocking the exact work it exempts.

# heredoc (allowed on purpose -- shell redirection stays visible in the
# command) and then run as a SEPARATE `python3 /tmp/.../patch.py` call sailed
# through, because that second call is a one-line script invocation with no

# so the only way to catch call two is to distrust script-file execution
# itself unless the path is one this repo has already reviewed and committed.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Committed-script exemption.
#
# `python3 scripts/<name>.py ...` runs a reviewed file that lives in the repo.
# Whatever it writes was written once, reviewed once, and is re-runnable -- the
# opposite of an inline program composed for one edit. The exemption is for the
# INVOCATION only: the command must not also carry an inline program, so a
# `python3 scripts/foo.py` followed by a `python3 -c '...open(p,"w")...'` in the
# same command stays denied.
#
# Fail-closed shape: a heredoc (`<<`), a `-c` inline program, or a `-` stdin
# program anywhere in the command disqualifies it, because those are exactly the
# forms that carry an inline program.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Any python invocation whose argument is a `.py` FILE PATH -- as opposed to
# inline code (`-c`), a heredoc, or stdin (`python3 -`) -- committed or not.
#
# The trailing context is "anything that is not a path character", NOT
# whitespace-or-end. A separator may abut the path with no space in front of
# it, and the narrower spelling missed every one of them. Measured 2026-09-17
# against the live policy, one command after the location fix landed:
# `python3 /tmp/.../patch.py` denied, `python3 /tmp/.../patch.py; echo
# "exit=$?"` ALLOWED -- the semicolon is not whitespace, so the path never
# matched and the script-file rule never fired. The `; echo "exit=$?"` suffix
# is not exotic either: another guard in this directory asks for a build's exit
# code to be read that way, so the bypass shape is one the harness encourages.

# home-relative path (`~/...`), and NOT a `..` escape out of the tree: none of
# those name a file this repo has committed or reviewed, no matter how closely
# they resemble `scripts/<name>.py` in shape. The old regex checked only the
# `.py` suffix and the absence of a leading dash, so `/tmp/.../patch.py` and
